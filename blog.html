            <h2>My First Blog in learning HTML</h2>
            <time datetime="2025-09-19">September 19, 2025</time>
            <p>Starting to learn HTML was both exciting and challenging for me. At first, I didn’t know anything about tags or how to structure a webpage. But I was curious to find out how websites are made, so I decided to try it myself.</p>

            <p>I began by studying the basic tags like html, head, title, and body. Writing the code felt strange because I had to follow many rules to make the page display correctly.</p>

            <p>The best part was seeing my code come alive in the browser. When I added text, images, or links, the webpage changed, and it made me proud. Learning how to use different tags helped me understand how websites are built from the ground up.</p>

            <h2>My Struggles in Life</h2>
            <time datetime="2025-09-18">September 18, 2025</time>
            <p>Life is full of challenges, and I have faced many struggles along the way. Sometimes, things do not go as planned, and it feels hard to keep moving forward. Whether in school, friendships, or personal goals, struggles have taught me important lessons.</p>

            <p>One of my biggest struggles has been managing time well. Balancing studies, family, and hobbies can be overwhelming. I often feel stressed trying to finish everything on time, but I am learning to organize better and take breaks when needed.</p>

            <p>Another challenge is dealing with self-doubt. There are moments when I question my abilities and feel unsure about my future. However, I remind myself that making mistakes is normal and part of growing. I try to stay positive and keep trying even when things get tough.</p>

            <p>Struggles have helped me become more patient and stronger. They show me that it’s okay to ask for help and that I am not alone. Every challenge is an opportunity to learn something new about myself and the world.</p>

            <p>Even though life has its ups and downs, I believe the struggles are what make us resilient and ready for better things ahead.</p>
